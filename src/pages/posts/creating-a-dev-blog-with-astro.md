### Another framework? *ðŸ™„*

Not exactly, [astro.build](https://astro.build/) works more like static site generators ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)).
The build produces no javascript by default, rendering is done at build time, the idea being to make it more difficult for developers to create sites with unnecessarily large bundles and jank user experience. 

### What about interactivity? 

Sure, most content on the web could be rendered statically, but I'm not prepared to go back to plain old form submits.
This is where it gets interesting. Astro solves [progressive enchacement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) through the [islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/).
You can choose to hydrate specific components with javascript in the browser, just choose a hydration strategy for each component.

```astro
---
// Example: hydrating a Svelte component in the browser.
import SvelteComponent from '../components/SvelteComponent.svelte';
---
<!-- "client:visible" means the component won't load any client-side
     JavaScript until it becomes visible in the user's browser. -->
<SvelteComponent client:visible />
```
