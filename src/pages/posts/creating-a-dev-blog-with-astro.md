### Another framework? *üôÑ*

Not exactly, [Astro](https://astro.build/) works more like static site generators ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)).
The build produces no javascript by default, rendering is done at build time, the idea being to make it more difficult for developers to create sites with unnecessarily large bundles and jank user experience. 

### What about interactivity? 

Sure, most content on the web could be rendered statically, but I'm not prepared to go back to plain old form submits.
This is where it gets interesting. Astro solves [progressive enchacement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) through the [islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/).
You can choose to hydrate specific components with javascript in the browser, just choose a hydration strategy for each component.

| Strategy               | Hydration       | Prerendered               |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `client:load`          | on page load    | **‚úîÔ∏è**                        |
| `client:idle`          | when main thread is free <br> [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) | **‚úîÔ∏è**                     |
| `client:visible`       | when element enters viewport <br> [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)     | **‚úîÔ∏è**   |
| `client:media={QUERY}` | when browser matches media query | **‚úîÔ∏è**   |
| `client:only`          | on page load                     | **‚ùå**    |

```astro
---
// Example: hydrating a Svelte component in the browser.
import SvelteComponent from '../components/SvelteComponent.svelte';
---
<!-- "client:visible" means the component won't load any client-side
     JavaScript until it becomes visible in the user's browser. -->
<SvelteComponent client:visible />
```

But how does [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) come into the picture?

### Framework agnostic

Instead of forcing you to learn another client side framework, Astro gives you the option to use
any of:
- React
- Svelte
- Vue
- Preact
- Web Components
- Plain old HTML + Javascript

I'm not sure building a site with multiple frameworks is a good idea, but flexibility is a good option down the road. You can also migrate your interactive *islands* on-by-one later.
